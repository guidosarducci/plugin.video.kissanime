- Will need to view a normal item listing or search listing containing shows before they will show up in the SQL version of visited and favorites.

- History201 lists anime recorded data from the sql db.  I plan on eventually using this data to draw from rather than metahandler when it exists.

- Show Visited State now checks both common cache and sql.

- Slight Adjustments made to the Download Function(s).
- To use either download Feature, remember to dissable the Auto-Play option in Settings so you can view the list of links.
- JDownloader Feature Made Available.  This could use a short little test by those who have it setup, with dropping me a message on the forum or IRC Chat to let me know how well it's working.
- Download Feature Made Available.  This includes the same type of Download-Methods as in my SolarMovie.so addon.
- Along with Genre(Select), the OldMenu feature now provides a method to view the Last... stuff in a submenu in order to work around any issues with refreshing the main menu when ran from a shortcut on the MainScreen of XBMC.
- Check out Settings for a Genre and All|#|A-Z Style changer to change the graphics for the 2 folder listings.  At this moment it looked like some links with -'s were having problems so some icons for 'ALL' don't seem to want to show up.

### AutoPlay feature seems to be working now for: Default (Default URL) | Next (Next Url is usually the highest quality Url I think.) | Last (Last is usually the lowest quality Url I think.).
### I've switched from enables for alternative autoplay options to a enum switch under General tab in Settings.
### In the end I had to save info at listEpisodes() to call later to go back to there after play, so to prevent the continual re-play issue.
### Tried a check via the title and url... that didn't help much if any at all.
### Many problems with list auto-refreshes causing it to be hard to get out of playing a video with auto-play on.
- Working on an AutoPlay Feature.
- listEpisodes() - Date Stamp Display changes.
- Option added to Settings for dissabling the view of Favorites 2-4.
- Another Code Cleanup.  Removed old methods since start of KissAnime/KissManga projects and some more of the older stuff from SolarMovie.so project days.
### Due to this, I'm converting the select menus to folder menus.
### Finding out that the select sort method select screen list has a problem of showing up again cause of some darn refreshing issue.
- Working on setting up a normal genre folder listing with the select sort method system.
- Plot fix for KeyError: (u'\u2014',) due to the adding of plot data from metadata.
- Added handling for catching the previously missing metadata tags in listItems() in default.py.
- Added some missing metadata tags to GRABMETA() in teh_tools.py.

[B]Version 0.3.1[/B]
- Major Break-through!  Addon can now pass playable links for multiple resolutions in .flv/.mp4/exc... formats available on the site.
- Moving "some" content type data to config.py to better keep the default.py simular in nature for KissAnime and KissManga.
- More Stuff done in listEpisode().  Label name parsing, Date information and Plot filled with misc info for easy viewing.
- Dated added to end of Episode Name like in KissManga addon.

[B]Version 0.3.0[/B]
- After a few seconds thought I did go ahead and add in an option in the Settings Window for having the old style method displayed as well.
- Old items on the MainMenu Removed/Hidden for genre/sortmethod folder list instead of the new select list.  Let me know if there's any interest in putting those back in, with a setting option to display them or not.
- Favorites Folder No. 3 and 4 have been added.  Remember that you can customize their names in the Settings Menu.
- _DoGetItems(), Select_AZ(), Select_Sort(), Select_Genre() added for the new choice list(s) method.  You can now choose All, Numbers (0-9), or A-Z for the Anime List.
- MetaHandler import added to addon.xml as a requirement.

[B]Version 0.2.9[/B]
- Normal Search - .replace(' ','+') - Fix was more for KissManga than for KissAnime, but it still works on both.
- Favorites - Fixed mode to 'GetEpisodes' to make it work.

[B]Version 0.2.8[/B]
- Some Slight changes using additional settings in config.py to make things easier to update in both kissanime and kissmanga addons.
- Side-Note: I am looking into how simular KissManga.com is to KissAnime.com... browsing looks 
- Backdrop/Fanart, Cover/Thumbnail, and some other metadata information setup  to be used when the User ENABLES the option in the Addon/Plugin Settings under Metadata.
- Metahandler setup (Thanks to The_Silencer for some code from TheDareTV).
- Metahandler import(s) moved from default.py to teh_tools.py.
- Additional Changes Made for Anime Settings in Settings Window.
- Favorites Empty fixed in Settings Window.
- Changed made to the displaying of Anime Series Names with color-tagging special tags.
- Favorites - Seems to be working fine.  I made a slight edit on the Displayed Names to do away with Year (and other such text) which is not included in this site's provided information.
- Changed made to the displaying of Episode Names.

[B]Version 0.2.7[/B]
- Project still needs a lot of code clean up and some more work, but I'm going to go ahead and release this version for people to use since it can now play videos, and has numerous features and categories to browse.
- Search - Feature added (Normal Search).
- listLinks() - The downloadable choices dont seem to wanna work reguardless of what I toss at it.  The contentURL finally works to play the videos.
- listEpisodes() - seems to be working so far.
- BrowseByAZ() - currently bugged.  By-passed for the time being, so no 0/A-Z... just All by default.
- BrowseByGenre() - working.
- listItems() - seems to be working so far.
- Main Menu - setup.

[B]Version 0.2.6[/B]
